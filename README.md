Skookum Web App Dev Challenge
=============================

Greetings, Internet Earthling. 

Resumes, interviews, and portfolios tell us a bit, but they don't show us how you creatively solve problems. That's pretty much the job. We want to be wowed and surprised by your code, so we came up with a really quick demo project that we'd like you to build. 

Here, you're looking at HotCatz‚ a metaphor of the types of applications we build on the reg. So this is your chance to show off how you'd approach a typical problem we'd field. 

HotCatz is a fantastic new startup that is totally going to be the next AppGoogFaceAzon‚ right after they raise some VC funding. Yep. Our job is to get them off the ground; take their initial investment and build out their first functional and working product. We do this with smart and nimble teams at Skookum Digital Works, and today, you're in charge. 

Here's what we need from you to turn HotCatz from an idea into a product:


STEPS

1.	Clone this git repository.

2.	Use the PSD in the /assets directory (it has layer comps) to create a single-page web app with the following functional requirements, non-functional requirements, and (optional) bonuses. This is designed to take 1-3 days.

3. 	Deploy your app to the Linode VPS. This is your box, so do whatever you like with it:

		ip: 0.0.0.0
		user: root
		password: pass


FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

1.  App should be deployable on an open-source stack. 

2.	User should be able to click on a cat picture in the 'VS' box to vote on that cat in the matchup. 

3.	User should see a new cat vs. cat matchup in the voting box after each vote. 

4.	'Current Results' list should update after each vote. 

5.	User should be able to hover over any of the small icons or text cat names in 'Current Results' to see a popup with the cat's full image. 

6.	User should be able to switch to 'upload mode' by clicking 'New Competitor.'

7.	User should be able to select a local image file to upload. 

8.	User should be able to input his/her cat's name. 

9.	User should be able to upload the name/image file pair. 

10. Images should be cropped to be a uniform size (but not stretched). 

11. User should be able to see a preview of the uploaded image. 

12. User should see her cat added to the list of contestants after upload.


NON-FUNCTIONAL REQURIMENTS

1.	Interface should feel slick. Smooth transitions should be used where possible (for example, switching between Vote and Upload modes). 

2.	B-grade browsers (like IE7) should be supported, but can render a less aesthetically appealing version of the site. Advanced CSS should degrade gracefully.

3.  Markup should be semantic and SEO-friendly. CSS should be clean and simple.


BONUSES

These are purely optional, but if you see a smart way to fit any in, it would be really cool:

1.	'Current Results' rendered live - for example, if user A is on the site and user B is voting, it would be great for A to see the the current results update in realtime. 

2.	User input on how her cat image is cropped during the upload process.

3.  Responsive, mobile UI.


DEVELOPMENT & DEPLOYMENT

1.	Development is totes your call. Ruby, node, Python, PHP, Clojure, Erlang - use whatever open-source stack shows you off the best.

2.  Please try to commit frequently (around an hour). This is both good practice (we encourage frequent small commits in our own projects) and so we can see your project come to life.

3.  If you have any questions, get in touch with hunter@skookum.com. There are no points lost for clarification.

4.	Once you're done, deploy it to the VPS server and email an IP link to hunter@skookum.com.



All of the above fun should show off plenty of your programming techniques and style. As always, feel free to surprise us with tricks and ideas of your own. HotCatz very much exemplifies the breadth of projects we take on at Skookum Digital Works. We're building businesses from the ground up, and we're hoping you can help build our team.
